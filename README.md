# Super Sheets **[WIP]**

This is a service that allows you to run arbitrary JS code against your Google Sheet.

The API lives in the `api/` directory and is deployed to Google Cloud Run.

To give the API access to your sheet, share the sheet with `19029134748-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com` with either View or Editor access.
